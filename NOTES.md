Please add any additional notes hereâ€¦

Hey, I throughly enjoyed working on this and spent the 4 hours as stated. I spent an hour Tuesday night and the remaining hours I did during Wednesday evening. I was only able to do the two endpoints and spent a lot of time getting the testing right. Thank you.

I decided to have the service layer handle all the business logic as it makes more scalable. In the getCardData function, I mapped the card json data and shaped it to how it was requested. I used a try catch to handle the errors as I thought it was the cleanest approach during the time. For the testing, I did the important tests such as the success or failures of the endpoints. But I think I seperated the concerns really well with the MVC structure so I am happy with my work.
